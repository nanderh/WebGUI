Allows the raspberry pi to be deployed and accesed through hostapd and does arpspoofing and sslstrip and cleans up the results.
Uses parselog.py to clean everything up: http://forum.intern0t.org/offensive-guides-information/2769-stealing-credentials-via-mitm-attacks-arpspoof-sslstrip-iptables.html

Prerequisites: lighttpd php5-cgi dnsiff sslstrip udhcpd hostapd

After install run: sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi-php

And for the moment add: www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
to /etc/sudoers. Not very safe or figure out which commands and files should be allowed and replace ALL with them.

In the /etc/default/hostapd don't change anything because otherwise it runs before the dhcp server is started which sometimes causes problems. 

The configs folder contains all the necessary config files.
When using the supplied lighttpd.conf the webserver is listening on port 81. This is necesarry because of the iptables port 80 traffic redirect. So feel free to use this one or any other port.
